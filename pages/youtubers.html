            <p>
              In the last year or so I have made an effort to change the type of online content I have been consuming.
              One of my goals was to support smaller creators and make the switch to content that focused on the real 
              world as opposed to gaming, etc. The first youtuber I found who fit the bill was 
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EvanMonsma">Evan Monsma</a>
              and the first video I saw was 
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAJbwe8Avi4">I Dropped Out and Moved Into a 100 Year Old Cellar</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking at the title you may asume this is a usual clickbait style youtube video, I definately did. But instead
              found a genuine story about a young guy moving out of home. The video and audio quality is not great but the 
              vibe is relaxing and real.
            </p>
              This is what I was looking for. Creators who just keep it simple and focus on what's important.
            <p>
              Although Evan was not my only inspiration for this site (I plan to discuss others on this page in future), 
              I think his videos do the best job of expressing the vibe I want to capture in it's creation.
            <p>
            </p>
              A few times in my life I have tried to turn hobbies into some money making venture or get competetive.
              Not I think that just leads to losing the reasons I enjoyed it so much to begin with. I think I'll take Evan's 
              advice from the message he puts at the end of all of his videos; "Made for the sake of making".
              I'll even keep it in the site footer for now as a reminder.
            <p>
            </p>
              Originally I was planning to write how Evan's channel had grown since I saw that first video. But I think 
              that would go against this attitude. Although for future reference, today he sits at 33.4k subscribers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks Evan
