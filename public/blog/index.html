      <h5>Evan Monsma and this site - Written 2025-01-23
        <h6 />
        <p>
          In the last year or so I have made an effort to change the type of content I have been consuming.
          switch to content that was slower and focused on the real world. This was imspored by being suggested one of
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EvanMonsma">Evan Monsma</a>'s videos
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAJbwe8Avi4">I Dropped Out and Moved Into a 100 Year Old Cellar</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The video and audio quality are not great but the
          vibe is relaxing and he tells a story.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think his videos do the best job of expressing the vibe I want to capture in this website.
        <p>
        </p>
        I also want to try and present some of my hobbies here in a low-effort and caual way.
        In the past I have held high standards for what constitutes as being "worth sharing" and
        this has lead to not releasing anything I make. Perfectionism is the enemy of just getting something out there.

        Evan uses the end-tag "Made for the sake of making".

          I was inspired to create this site by
          <a href="https://melonking.net/thoughts/manifesto">The Melonking Manifesto</a>
          but there's not much to see here yet... In the meantime, have a
          <a href="https://skysedge.com/work/index.html">cool link</a>. 
          Have a look around that site, there's a lot of interesting stuff.
