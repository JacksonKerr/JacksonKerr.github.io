                <p>
                    If I break my own rules only before I state them, maybe I'll get away with it.
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: 'minimono';">
                    It is my goal that everything on my site (except the links section but duh) should be made by me. 
                    I don't really want to respond directly to other media. I want to create new things. Recently I came to the 
                    horrible realisation that every time this page is loaded, it's using a font made by someone else. Even worse,
                    that font can be different depending on what browser/device you use which sometimes caused things to be slightly
                    out of alignment.
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: 'minimono';">
                    The simple solution was to make my own font. As you probably guessed, this is it. Here's all the characters:
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: 'minimono'; font-size: 25px;">
                    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
                    <br/>
                    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
                    <br/>
                    0123456789
                    <br/>
                    !@#$%^&*()-=_+[]{};:'"<>,./?`~
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: 'minimono';">
                    I went for a minimal blocky look. It's fine. The file size is small, but it's no work of art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you care about this? Is this interesting to anyone except for me? Should I care if it isn't?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In making this font, I thought this might be a good thing to write about until I considered;
                    Are most of the entries on this site just going to be about making the site? And if so, is that interesting?
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: 'minimono';">
                    No, I don't think it is...
                </p>
                <p>
                    A blog about making a blog is only interesting to someone learning how to make a blog, and even then maybe 
                    just as a means to an end. Sculptors don't spend all day making statues of chisels, and the best books
                    aren't about publishing or overcoming writers block. These examples seem silly but for some reason, on the
                    internet (and especially the blog space) people seem to constantly write about writing on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I aim to avoid this from now on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, and by the way. I'm not happy enough with this font to go on using it for the whole site. 
                    I may get around to making another one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peace out

                <p>
                    I've been using a "dumbphone" for I think about a year now. It can only use SMS and make/receive calls. 
                    It has no internet connection. I hold this as one of the best decisions I ever made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I had already taken steps to limit my social media; I had deleted Instagram and Facebook off of 
                    my smartphone a year prior. Here in New Zealand most people I know use Facebook Messenger as their main 
                    avenue for communication. I was worried about losing contact with friends and family. Ah, the dreaded FOMO.
                    Eventually I decided to try it "just for a couple of days". I grabbed an $80 candy bar phone on my way home 
                    from work and all my apprehensions melted away.

                    Well, what about that FOMO?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It turns out that for the most part people who care about you are willing to send you a text message instead
                    of a Facebook DM. And I started treating the group chat more like an email chain. I could check it on my computer 
                    at work an hour before leaving work to see if there were any invites to events and that pretty much solved 
                    my problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What about banking? I set up my debit card so that CHQ/Paywave accesses my weekly budget and SAV accesses my 
                    short term savings. This means that if I will never be somewhere and not have access to money. Maps? I look 
                    up the directions before I leave, if it's complicated I'll write them down in a notebook I carry. Email? 
                    Why do you need to see emails at the pub??? Do it when you get home!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ok, here's the part where I admit that I've been lying to you. It turned out that I actually couldn't live my
                    normal life without a smartphone. My work, my bank, steam, and a lot of other things require an authenticator 
                    app for login. My gym requires an app FFS. Also, what if I want to listen to music? Well... For this I still
                    use a smartphone and a Digital Audio Plater (effectively a tiny android tablet). The smartphone stays in my
                    drawer at work and the DAP stays at home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far I've only talked about the issues with using a dumbphone. If you're a full time smartphone user 
                    this whole thing probably sounds silly to you. It did to me the first time I heard about someone using
                    a candybar phone in the 2020s. Modern smartphones are arguably the most effective tool that humanity has 
                    ever created. Why would anyone want to give that up? Put simply, 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke0lFon3UhU&list=PLgKGxseK8LoUg9T4YT4DsQEBRLoTltEKd&index=62">
                        there are hidden costs to owning a smartphone 
                    </a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I was already vigilant about managing notifications and unsubscribing from bullshit emails,
                    there are always things that slip through the cracks. Do I really need that group chat notification
                    in the middle of fixing an issue at work? Or when enjoying time with friends? The benefit of the
                    dumbphone is that I know that when it beeps, someone is actively trying to get in contact with me 
                    specifically. Not just someone sending me a meme or sharing a post.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've found that since switching, my time out of the house has had a completely different vibe to it.
                    There are few objects in out lives that spend the same amount of time with us as out phones so a change
                    effects a lot more of you life than you may thing. I no longer have a 24/7 entertainment machine on me 
                    at all times. Whenever I am out of the house, I am present. The lack of a phone changes sitting in a waiting
                    room, being on the bus, or otherwise waiting somewhere. When I'm bored I'm compelled to talk to the people
                    around me, take in my surroundings, or just go into my own mind. When I wake up in the morning I get 
                    straight out of bed. No more wasted time scrolling. I've also noticed that I sleep much better. Something
                    else I did not expect is how much more I notice the people around me being on their phones.
                </p>
                <p>  
                    Using a dumbphone is one of those things where the drawbacks are clear, but the benefits are indirect. You
                    really need to give it a go to know what you will gain and whether the drawbacks will actually apply to you.
                    I implore you to give it a go, even just to try it out for a couple of days. The only piece of advice I will
                    give to you is that 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwUcSMfBilY">there is no such thing as the perfect dumbphone</a>.
                    So don't get hung up on finding it. Just walk into the store and buy the cheapest one available. If you must 
                    have a specific recommendation; the 
                    <a href="https://www.tcl.com/my/en/feature-phones/tcl-4042s">TCL Onetouch 4042</a>.
                    is very simple to use and I have had no issues with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most phones have a screen time feature, check it and see if that would convince you. Do you think you are going
                    to look back in 5 years and wish you spent more time staring at a screen or less. The quote "The only people 
                    that will remember you worked late are your kids" has always stuck with me and I think applies here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Go on, see if those T9 typing skills are still in the mind palace somewhere.

                <p>
                    In the last year or so I have made an effort to change the type of content I have been
                    consuming.
                    My goal was to switch to content that was slower and focused on the real world. This was inspired by
                    being
                    suggested one of
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EvanMonsma">Evan Monsma</a>'s videos
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAJbwe8Avi4">I Dropped Out and Moved Into a 100 Year

                    The video and audio quality are not great but the
                    vibe is relaxing and he tells a story.

                    I think his videos do the best job of expressing the vibe I want to capture in this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to present my hobbies here in a low-effort and caual way.
                    In the past I have held high standards for what constitutes as being "worth sharing" and
                    this has lead to not releasing anything I make. Perfectionism is the enemy of just getting
                    something out there.

                    Evan uses the end-tag "Made for the sake of making" which speaks to me.
